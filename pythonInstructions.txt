Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators


Python Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

+------------------+------------+--------+
| Operator         | Name       | Example|
+------------------+------------+--------+
| +                | Addition   | x + y  |
| -                | Subtraction| x - y  |
| *                | Multiplication | x * y|
| /                | Division   | x / y  |
| %                | Modulus    | x % y  |
| **               | Exponentiation | x ** y |
| //               | Floor division | x // y |
+------------------+------------+--------+





Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

+-------+-----------+--------------+
| Operator | Example   | Same As      |
+-------+-----------+--------------+
| =       | x = 5     | x = 5        |
| +=      | x += 3    | x = x + 3    |
| -=      | x -= 3    | x = x - 3    |
| *=      | x *= 3    | x = x * 3    |
| /=      | x /= 3    | x = x / 3    |
| %=      | x %= 3    | x = x % 3    |
| //=     | x //= 3   | x = x // 3   |
| **=     | x **= 3   | x = x ** 3   |
| &=      | x &= 3    | x = x & 3    |
| |=      | x |= 3    | x = x | 3    |
| ^=      | x ^= 3    | x = x ^ 3    |
| >>=     | x >>= 3   | x = x >> 3   |
| <<=     | x <<= 3   | x = x << 3   |
+-------+-----------+--------------+


Python Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

+-------+-------------------------+---------+
| Operator | Name                    | Example |
+-------+-------------------------+---------+
| ==      | Equal                   | x == y  |
| !=      | Not equal               | x != y  |
| >       | Greater than            | x > y   |
| <       | Less than               | x < y   |
| >=      | Greater than or equal to | x >= y |
| <=      | Less than or equal to    | x <= y |
+-------+-------------------------+---------+


Python Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

+-------+---------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Operator | Description             | Example                          |
+-------+---------------------------+----------------------------------+
| and     | Returns True if both statements are true | x < 5 and x < 10              |
| or      | Returns True if one of the statements is true | x < 5 or x < 4                |
| not     | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true | not(x < 5 and x < 10)          |
+-------+---------------------------+----------------------------------+


Python Membership Operators
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

+--------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+
| Operator | Description                   | Example         |
+--------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+
| in       | Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object | x in y         |
| not in   | Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object | x not in y     |
+--------+-----------------------------------+-----------------+

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b

Python has two primitive loop commands:

•while loops
•for loops

Python For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

Nested Loops
A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.

The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function can return data as a result

Arguments
Information can be passed into functions as arguments.

Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

Parameters or Arguments?
The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.

From a function's perspective:

A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

Number of Arguments
By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.

Arbitrary Arguments, *args
If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a * before the parameter name in the function definition.

Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs
If you do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function, add two asterisk: ** before the parameter name in the function definition.

You can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it will be treated as the same data type inside the function.

Recursion
Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.

Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.

The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.

In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).

To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it.

lambda syntax
lambda arguments : expression

Why Use Lambda Functions?
The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.

Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:
